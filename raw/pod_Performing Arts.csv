Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that.

The 931 episodes broadcast were all based on popular films with the biggest stars of Hollywood playing the parts and during its heyday the audience was estimated as high as forty million. The one-and-only Cecil B. DeMille was your host (1936-45) for a lavish production of what was to become a veritable film checklist of many of Hollywoods best films from the mid-30s right through the mid 50s. Every genre is included, from darkest noir crime dramas to historical epics to bubbly musicals and broad comedies. There are some titles that are less known today, and that makes them even more historical. The stars of the movie are usually in the productions, although sometimes contracts or schedules meant that another star took the part. In some another star would be featured in one of the major roles. The productions were live, with full orchestra, and many Hollywood legends were unused to performing in public without the benefit of retakes. Needless to say, the performances in every show are singular. The Lux Radio Theatre is a masterpiece in OTRs crown, and each show is a historical time capsule that takes us back to the glamour of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",Performing Arts,http://www.botar.us/luxradiotheatre.html

We'll also have special guests along the way ranging from people actually involved in the production (cast members and the creative team), to the minds behind some of the best social media accounts inspired by the show, to teachers who use the music to get their students excited about history, and everything in between. The discussion of Ron Chernow's ""Alexander Hamilton"" starts in episode three. If you're interested, please feel free to read along with us; we'll be going chapter-by-chapter. But there's no pressure! There's plenty to talk about and we're not treating this like a super serious history class. We're just here to have fun with people who also love Hamilton. When we started this podcast, only Bianca had seen Hamilton. Thanks to an incredibly generous listener, Gillian and Bianca were lucky enough to see Hamilton together the same day Lin-Manuel Miranda won the Pulitzer Prize. How lucky we are to be alive right now FOR REAL. If you have any great Ham stories or funny references you've come across, please let us know! We love hearing about things like that.

The radio show first aired on April 26, 1952 and ran until June 18, 1961 on the CBS radio network. The series starred William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Deputy Chester Proudfoot. Doc?s first name and Chester?s last name were changed for the television program. Gunsmoke was notable for its critically acclaimed cast and writing, and is commonly regarded as one of the finest old time radio shows. Some listeners have argued that the radio version of Gunsmoke was far more realistic than the television program. Episodes were aimed at adults, and featured some of the most explicit content of the day: there were violent crimes and scalpings, massacres and opium addicts. Miss Kitty?s occupation as a prostitute was made far more obvious on the radio version than on television. Many episodes ended on a down-note, and villains often got away with their crimes.",Performing Arts,http://www.otrwesterns.com/gunsmoke/
DJ Mark Picchiotti Mix Series,THE PERFECT MIX™ :: EVERY WED OF EACH MONTH @ 8PM ET (GMT-4) :: MINIMALIXTIX™ :: SECOND TUE OF EACH MONTH @ 12 ET (GMT-4) :,,,,DJ Ferro,Arts,,,,,,13,casadeferro.com,4.61537,"who is ricardo ferro? Ricardo is also known as DJ Ferro since his debuts in the world of djing, bringing us back to 1988. Very loyal to the electronic culture club since then, Ferro has become a key name of the Portuguese underground music scene. Born in Lisbon in 24th April 1973, he spent his early days in the well-known region of Algarve, southern Portugal. When he turned 18 years old he moved back to Lisbon on his own, not only because the attraction of the big city life but mainly because of his strong desire of getting to know artists and people involved in the dance scene. He was eager to make a breakthrough as well as establishing his style and own sound to a bulky audience. It was only a matter of time, for those who remember, before his name started circulating around the elite and was being offered to playing in such places like: Locomia, Rocks, ZONA+, Coconuts, Plateau, Alcantara-Mar amongst others. When still working in the record shop Bimotor in charge of the imports, he formed a collective with A.paul and Wogz, two successful Techno Dj?s in Portugal, which would lead to the creation of a specific Portuguese techno label - Squeeze Records. Squeeze 001 ( A.paul & Ferro) appeared to be the so much wanted breakthrough, a smash! The right music was released at the right time and obviously the interest of the public kept growing. The next step was a very much awaited and acclaimed Compilation. Outside Portugal boundaries the success was discreet but flourishing. The German distributor Neuton shipped Squeeze around Europe and DJs like Sven Vath, Chris Liebing and Hardfloor charted it. At a certain point, during the ?boom? of dance music in Portugal, X-Club acknowledged his work with a invitation to be one of the X artists, were he finally was able to set up his career. Places like Colombia and Slova?quia, playing with DJs like Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Dave Clarke, Richie Hawtin, The Advent, Mike Dearborn, DJ Rush, Derrick Carter, Dave Angel, Darren Price, Stacey Pullen, DJ Sneak, Green Velvet, Josh Wink, Damon Wild, Steve Stoll, Adam Beyer, Ben Long and many others, are common to him. Today Ricardo Ferro is the Label Manager of FAROL, the label of Media Capital and also the exclusive distributor of Warner Music in Portugal. His love for production is still alive, and he regularly delivers his new material. He also keeps his agenda full with gigs in Portugal and abroad. In less than a decade, Ricardo Ferro managed to impose his fresh sound and smooth style with a clever blend of Techno, Techouse, Hardhouse, Progressive House, House and even Electro, his recent collaboration with Mourah under the project Echosonic is an example of it. Year after year he proves to his faithful audience to be an innovative, versatile and open-minded artist. One who deserves all the respect he has been rewarded with. ricardo ferro discography Released A.Paul & Ferro ""Squeeze Gently Ep"" (Squeeze001) Dj Ferro ""Shakuachi Ep"" (Squeeze007) Dj Ferro ""Blue Vibration"" (WorldMusicLP001) Dj Ferro ""Juicy Kisses"" (upfront) Dj Ferro ""Fire ep"" (Naked Lunch 008) Dj Ferro ""Moribayassa EP"" (Naked Lunch 025) Dj Ferro ""Especial"" (Parallel 125 - &035;28) Remixes Mesa ""Divagadora"" Viper ""Sanzala"" (Squeeze) Humanoyd ""Mr Galaxy"" (Squeeze) Dj Wogz ""Gloopuk"" (Squeeze) As a producer Oscar Baia ""Z"" (Squeeze) mixed CDs by ricardo ferro Squeezed Hardheads (Squeeze Records / MCA) The G Spot (Genesis / Zona Musica) Secret Society mixed by A.

Shortly after releasing the first few episodes, we narrowed our focus to create a podcast that was unique in concept and would serve a community near and dear to us: DRAG QUEENS!!!!!!!!!!!!! The podcast is equal parts oral history and good old-fashioned kiki. We found that there were few platforms where Drag and Nightlife Artists could talk about their art and themselves in an open and honest way. Most of what is known about these artists comes from videos posted on the Internet or what they experience in bars and clubs. It was clear that there were stories to be told and shared with the world. Our mission is to create a comfortable and safe environment, where these artists can share their histories and experiences. Ours is a podcast that is meant to serve the drag and nightlife community by capturing the artists? voices and making them available to the public.

Or a wistful ?Do y?all remember that time...? But it always comes. Here, in our little corner of the country, they always come. The South has always marked time by its stories. They carry our history. Our fathers and grandfathers. Wars. Hunting trips. Good dogs. Great loves. Brass badges and bank robbers. Our everyday lives.
