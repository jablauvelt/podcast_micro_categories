      " [ 'Earth Ancients chronicles the growing (and often suppressed) evidence of known and unknown civilizations, their ruined cities, and artifacts developed from advanced science and technology. Erased from the pages of time, these cultures discovered and charted the heavens, developed medicine and unleashed advancements that parallel and, in many cases, surpass our own. Join us and discover our lost history. Armed with the thousands of anomalous archeological discoveries which have not been covered by conventional science and the media, we can no longer deny our ancient cultural inheritance. Our written history is wrong and we?ve been led to believe that humanity is just a few hundred thousand years old. In fact, the Hindu Yugas advance the notion that Homo Sapiens are millions of years old, and have lived on planet Earth through a series of rebirths. It?s now a fact that we are the survivors of a series of cataclysmic events that took place approximately 12,000 to 14,000 years ago. Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled underground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished. Though Earth Ancients does explore some of the popular theories that ancient aliens have visited our planet, our philosophy and research paradigm is decidedly Earth-centric, elevating the historical discourse about human brilliance and ingenuity found in the archaeological evidence. For example, many of the lost cultures were able to: ? Harness natural electromagnetic field and channel them to build pyramids and colossal buildings ? Power tools and machines to shape sculptures and cut water channels ? Execute superior scientific and technical abilities lost to modern society']\n",
