The tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, especially by seeking entertainment or engaging in fantasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways attempting to smooth the pain with the half truths. Being honest is not cool today. It is not the thing to do. However, it should not be the gold standard of who we are. Honesty is a core element to the character that will be needed to survive in this world moving forward. Everything is being recorded, whether on video, audio, and written its all being document somewhere. Everything we do or say can come back to us in the future. Even if we do not intend for it too. This is why it is so critical to advance our thoughts, speech, and actions with every intention of keeping it real with ourselves first.

The book opens the night of a very high-profile music awards show where Scroo?e will be honored.

Or will he continue doing any and everything to benefit only Scroo?e?   On October 20, 2016, when On Top Of The World (Until The Bell Chimes) is released by Woolly Mammoth Books, you will have your questions answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout David Lamb\\r\\n\\r\\n   David Lamb is a native New Yorker, born and raised, bitten with the writing bug since he was in elementary school and had handwriting nobody could decipher. Like Charles Dickens, David grew up a poor boy in the big city who found that the pen really is mightier than the sword.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn middle school, Lambs hero was David Lampel whose velvet voice could be heard reporting the news over Davids grandmothers radio. Whenever he heard him on the radio, David would substitute Lamb for Lampel and pretend he was delivering the news. Sure that he was destined to be a famous reporter, David was happy to go to a high school with a journalism program. Like most kids, by the time he finished high school he had a whole new career in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter high school, he went to Hunter College and majored in Economics because he wanted to be cool like that college kid who came to speak at his last year of high school. He was an Economics major, he was dressed sharp and above-all, the girls thought he was the man! So like any unreasonable high school boy fueled by overactive hormones, David figured if he majored in Economics,  theyd think he was cool.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finishing college, David went on to law school at NYU, but all the time, writing was still his heart. While working as a lawyer by day, at night he transformed into a writer and eventually wrote and produced the award-winning hit off-Broadway romantic comedy, Platanos Y Collard Greens. Being a writer and having the chance make people laugh out loud while challenging them to think about the world around them while inspiring each of us to believe in the power of love. And our own ability to overcome lifes challenges is a great gift that David truly enjoys and thanks you for allowing him to share with you in On Top Of The World (Until The Bell Chimes).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo learn more about David Lamb, please visit: http://davidlamb.club/ and {Twitter} a href=\"https://twitter. I have come to the conclusion that change is the process of altering habits of culture (I will explain this further in a later blog post). Change is something that is often a part of any solution. However, I have found that Change is never defined clearly. It is like we are just supposed to know what the hell Change looks like. So, after doing some deep thinking, research, and debating, I have concluded that cultures must pivot to see the desired outcomes you want. Therefore, we must define what culture is before we try to change anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA set of behaviors, beliefs, concepts, linguistics, experiences and expectations, which are scribed to a social (people, place, or thing) collective to meet the (direct or indirect) agreed upon wants and needs.

He has experience in lm, graphic design, marketing and advertising. He recently directed and produced his first feature-length documentary entitled Wilmington on Fire which is on the 1898 Wilmington Massacre/Coup in Wilmington, NC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wilmington Massacre was a bloody attack on the African-American community by a heavily armed white mob with the support of the North Carolina Democratic Party on November 10, 1898 in the port city of Wilmington, North Carolina. It is considered one of the only successful examples of a coup de?tat in the United States that left countless numbers of African-American citizens dead and exiled from the city. This event was the springboard for the white supremacy movement and Jim Crow segregation throughout the state of North Carolina and the American South.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nWilmington on Fire gives a compelling historical and present day look at this event showing how the violent overthrow of an existing government not only cemented white supremacy in the city of Wilmington and the state of North Carolina but also throughout the United States of America.

Mike Street and Thomas Calhoun discuss his upcoming book Something Missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the Book\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you know that seventy percent of workers report being disengaged at work? The startup renaissance is revolutionizing our economy by changing the definition of work: what it looks like as well as when, where, how, and for whom we do it. For some, this has been a lucrative shift in American culture. Women and minorities, however, are not experiencing the same shift. Specifically, African American, Hispanic, and women entrepreneurs are receiving less than one percent of venture capital annually, which decreases the likelihood of successfully taking the leap. Overall, this change has brought about the question of why we do the work we do. Does it make us happy? Fulfill us? Or, does it just pay the bills until we find whats missing?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Somethings Missing, Thomas Calhoun Jr. encourages you to lead a more purposeful existence by exposing a few inconvenient truths, asking tough questions, and sharing how his personal journey within shaped his career as an entrepreneur. Allow Thomas to walk you step-by-step through the Seven Ps of Purpose(TM) to find your why and walk in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Thomas Calhoun Jr.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an HBCU & PWI graduate, Thomas Calhoun Jr. has experienced both sides of the debate as well as written about it. Since 2008, Thomas has been a full-time entrepreneur primarily in the government services space. In the end, his commitment to the HBCU community, passion for entrepreneurship, and belief in the power of cooperative economics to improve the social dilemma Black people are facing in America led him to leave government contracting in 2014. Since then, he has written a book entitled Somethings Missing and focused on nafasi  a virtual innovation ecosystem connecting women and minority founders to the talent and capital they need to succeed.

Prior to becoming a recording artist, Moses worked with her best friend Nonja McKenzie as an assistant wardrobe stylist for artists such as Will Smith, Kelis, R. Kelly, and No Doubt.

In 1983, Dr. Teer expanded the vision of NBT by purchasing a 64,000-square-foot building on 125th Street and Fifth Avenue (renamed National Black Theatre Way in 1994). This was the first revenue-generating black arts complex in the country, an innovative arrangement through which for-profit businesses who shared NBTs spiritual and aesthetic values rented retail space to subsidize the arts. Out of her vision, NBT houses the largest collection of Nigerian new sacred art in the Western hemisphere and is considered the authentic representation of a model whose time has come. NBT is partially supported by grants from the City Council of New York, Listen as Mike Street chats with actor Ben Patterson about his career and current projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout Ben Patterson\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican actor, model, musician and photographer Ben Patterson is best known for his pivotal and culturally important roles as the trans gendered brother of Dr. Ben Warren on ABCs massively popular Greys Anatomy and the groundbreaking drama Noahs Arc, is set to return to television this summer on OWNs Greenleaf alongside executive producer Oprah Winfrey, who also stars on the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nSet in Memphis,Greenleaf follows the unscrupulous world of the Greenleaf family with scandalous secrets and lies, and their powerful megachurch with predominantly African-American church members. The series is headed by Keith David as Bishop James Greenleaf, and Lynn Whitfield as his wife and matriarch of the family, Lady Mae Greenleaf.Merle Dandridge plays series protagonist, Grace Greenleaf, their estranged daughter who has returned home after 20 years following the mysterious death of her sister, Faith. Oprah stars as Mavis McCready, Lady Maes sister and a close confidant of Grace who is also a blues club owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn Oakland native, Ben grew up in a diverse neighborhood of the San Francisco Bay, playing the drums and swimming competitively through high school with future television stars Lance Gross (Tyler Perrys House of Payne) and Russell Hornsby (NBCs Grimm). As an aspiring musician he picked up the guitar and piano, while booking DJ gigs at house parties and local nightclubs, which continued while he was a psych major at San Diego State University. Discovered by a scout for a local modeling competition that he ultimately won as International Model of the Year, he quickly booked campaigns for Macys, Bud Light and various infomercials. Another model suggested him for a walk on role on The Bold and the Beautiful thus launching his acting career and the rest is history. He has since appeared on CSI-Miami, Happy Endings, Brother and Sisters, and Castle to name a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen hes not filming, Ben is a new father to a 3-month old son and spending time in the kitchen cooking with his husband. A fitness fanatic since his modeling days, he stays fit by practicing yoga and hiking the various trails around Los Angeles. An avid photographer hes shot many upcoming actors headshots and editorial images while sharing his insights on the industry as someone who appears comfortably on both sides of the lens. With his new music being produced to be released on iTunes this summer there isnt an end in sight for this renaissance man, who often wonders how he balances it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have anything you want to share?\\r\\n\\r\\nLeave us your comments down below! \\r\\n\\r\\na class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" hr...

      "[ 'This presentation will center around the Eracism Project (the newest Flat Classroom Project), which was proposed by students at the 2009 Conference and will be an international middle school debate project held in September  December 2009, planned and conducted entirely by students. This presentation will have two phases: 1) An enhanced podcast or full video presentation with Vicki Davis, Julie Lindsay, Bernajean Porter, and Peggy Sheehy discussing the practical pedagogy and outcomes of connecting students globally in a way that begins with the objective and ends with the selection of appropriate technology tools for the task, centering around this particular project as the example, but also including other projects planned by each presenter. This will be a 20 minute presentation. 2) The culmination of the Eracism project, which will have preliminary debates hosted on voicethread will provide K12 online participants a venue to observe students in their final virtual world debate competition, but with k12 online participants allowed to observe and reflect in real time using a private backchannel. This will be the culmination of the Eracism project. 3) Student voicethreads used as part of the debate will be provided for participant viewing. Myths and realities of copyrights as they relate to multimedia projects in the classroom with Mathew Needleman. As the first decade of the 21st century comes to end and blogs, wikis, and podcasts have become more mainstream, it is important that educators step back to see how we, as professionals, are best using these tools to serve our students learning needs. If these modern technologies are going to be sustained in contemporary pedagogy, it is time that we kick it up a notch and tie these tools to both a higher theme and to learning theories. In other words, rather than using technology for technologys sake, we need to rest on a new 21st-century foundation of teaching, learning, and assessment theory. Through a screencast, webcam, and Power Point video, Googlios offers not simply a how to but a why to; it introduces a model of how one educator has come to understand and organize these tools to support a 21st-century constructivist and connectivist approach to bridge the divide in educating our digital natives. More specifically, this presentation will shed light on a model that demonstrates relationships between emerging tools and learning theories and between Personal Learning Environments (PLEs), Personal Learning Networks (PLNs), and ePortfolios. By using Google Sites as a main dashboard that mashes up multiple Google Apps like Blogger, Youtube, Google Reader, Google Maps, Google Docs, and iGoogle into an ePortfolio, students can build and organize their own Personal Learning Environment (PLE) simultaneously with building bridges through their Personal Learning Network (PLN)all while supporting e-portfolio authentic assessment. One last word of caution: Googlios: A 21st-Century Approach to Teaching, Learning, and Assessment seeks to ignite an educational renaissance. Neil Stephenson believes in the power of technology to bring the past into the future. Empowered with 21st century tools, Stephensons Grade 7 students reinterpret events from five periods that have shaped Canadas current historical landscape. Called the Cigar Box Project, Stephensons students collect and analyze historical images and artifacts, and then use graphic design principles to digitally assemble new cigar panels, each one revealing a unique, visual perspective of an historical event or time from Canadas past. At the end of the year, students physically build their wooden Cigar Boxes, creating their own historical artifact that pulls together the story of our country. Along the way, students encounter a variety of assessment practices, create mini-documentaries about their artifacts and meet a number of experts who support their historical learning. This presentation explores a range of ideas that teachers could use to make a real-world task richer and more meaningful for their students. Using a large public art event as the focus, it looks at a number of ideas for enriching student learning with technology ideas that could be modified and applied to nearly any learning context. How do you build a hands on program that students like?  I explain the process and steps to my skateboard program. I show actually video and pictures of students using the tools, designing, painting and building their skateboard.

After a brief introduction Ollie Bray describes the use of commercially available computer games in the classroom. In particular he focuses on why the use of games are appropriate for learning and teaching. He then goes on to describe an innovative project that was piloted in is own schools learning community that uses the game Guitar Hero as a contextual hub for learning and to help children make the transition between primary school to secondary school (elementary school to high school). The project has now been adopted in various forms in schools all across Scotland and further afield. This presentation describes the use of a free video annotation tool, VideoAnt, for providing specific, targeted feedback to students video productions. It contains a tutorial on using VideoAnt and then illustrates the use of VideoAnt to make comments on some high school students video production, followed by a teacher and student discussing the value of receiving this feedback.

Jane Ross is an Apple Distinguished Educator and has recently graduated from a Masters in Education (Ed Tech) which she did entirely online from Australia. Jane is the Digital Technologies Specialist for Sinarmas World Academy in Indonesia. She is a regular presenter in Indonesia, often presenting in Indonesian which is her second language. Emerging technologies, a globalized world, and fiscal restraints demand innovative approaches to education. This session explores new research about 21st century teaching strategies and professional development and shares models, resources, and examples to help social studies teachers effectively integrate technology and address needed skills. This presentation will help participants think about the differences between a project that is a glorified drop box or parallel play and one that truly involves students in authentic work which is purposeful, personally meaningful and engaging and that meets a need in the world today. This video highlights innovative educational uses of the Read-Write Web and shows how humanities teachers use Web 2.0 to empower students and facilitate creative and meaningful learning opportunities. The session includes a conceptual framework for e-learning 2.0, and showcases existing classroom projects that incorporate Web 2.0 in learning. Do you recognize the wow of your students? Are we cultivating such passion? Angela shares a story of a young learner and the habits necessary to ignite such a wow in students. This K12 Online Conference presentation describes the writers workshop conducted with a group of upper elementary students. The focus was on the process of writing combining hands-on and technology activities with a special focus on the engagement of multiple intelligences. Explore the evolution of blogs in a high school art program, from a class blog to individual blogs to working in a drupal environment with other students. Students used blogs to exhibit work, reflect on their creative process and engage in meaningful critique with their peers. What were the hurdles? How were they addressed? What worked well? What needed to change?Hear one schools story and see what might work for you. I am a foreign language teacher in a high school in Berga (Spain). We are using blogs as a tool to learn a foreign language. Here you will find three experiences I have used. I hope you enjoy it. Opensimulator is open source software for creating 3D virtual worlds. OpenLearning is learning without artificial restrictions. This presentation is about jumping on the open virtual worlds for learning bandwagon and about giving you a start on using them in your classroom. For more information, resources, classroom examples and links, check out my accompanying blog post at edutim.com. Can a worldwide scavenger hunt and a GPSr change the way we teach? ABSOLUTELY! This presentation will introduce geocaching and educaching and provide examples and resources to those interested in getting students out of the classroom! This presentation highlights the use of Google Maps and Google Earth (and Picasa photo)to create a fictional Heroic Journey story. The unit is tied to literature (The Odyssey, The Lightning Thief), writing (creating an original story with episodes of adventure) and technology (integrating online tools into the classroom). The presentation includes some sample student work from sixth graders but I encourage you to follow the links to the website where the student journeys are posted. En el aula de segundo de primaria utilizamos algunos recursos de la web 2.0 para mejorar nuestra comunicacion oral y escrita. El microblogging, mensajes con webcam y grabacion de audios son alguno de los ejemplos que presento. Carol Broos and Carol Vrotny, two music teachers discuss the creative process of composing music in the digital age. All links can be found at http://musictechie.pbworks.com Rachel Boyds keynote presentation for the Week in the Classroom strand of the K12 Online conference. A peek for a week inside a kiwi junior classroom of 6 year olds. Come and see what we get up to in our classroom learning during a week using a variety of online and web2 tools. Please note that due to this presentation also being visual it is best viewed with audio AND visuals in movie format. The world is their audience, literally, when high school students embark on a Flat Classroom Project. As a culmination to the 12-14 week global collaborative project students have the opportunity to present their research and findings in real time through a virtual classroom. Guests internationally are invited to attend and ask questions and interact with the students. This experience goes beyond the usual classroom sharing model and promotes awareness of the scope of a global audience, confidence in public speaking and enhanced cultural exchange. This session shares highlights from recent Flat Classroom Student Summits and provides a pedagogical approach that allows safe collaboration and sharing and pushes the limits of classroom experience into a blended 21st century and Web 2.0 model. This session will showcase best student work from the Flat Classroom project and show how students present their research and learning to an international audience. Using a virtual classroom, students from around the world present to their peers and to educators and guests and field questions. The aim of this session is to show how powerful an online learning community is and how Web 2.0 tools can support and enhance the learning experience globally. Participants will be exposed to tools and methods for facilitating this style of online showcase. The amazing innovation we are seeing in many classrooms around the world still has a small impact, when compared to the size of our educational systems. How do we bridge the divides to go bigger? This presentation will explore some divides, from a Colombian perspective, and will propose some ideas that could help in bridging them. La fabulosa innovacion que vemos en muchos salones de clase alrededor del mundo todavia tiene un impacto pequeno, en comparacion con el tamano de nuestros sistemas educativos. Como creamos puentes para cerrar las brechas y crecer mas? Esta presentacion explorara algunas brechas, desde una perspectiva colombiana, y propondra algunas ideas que pueden ayudar a crear puentes para cerrarlas. This presentation provides a snapshot of web 2.0 and games based learning which have been implemented in our school and how we have managed to achieve this across all grades Kindergarten to Year 6. We have been using these technologies for several years but it has only been in this last year that there has been a wholesale uptake of these learning resources. 96% of our students are from non English speaking backgrounds. Many of them arrive at school with impoverished language and life experiences. it is our mission to enrich their vocabulary, turn them on to reading and writing and engage them in the process of becoming critical and creative lifelong learners using technology as the tool. Web 2.0 is more than a set of technology tools. It reflects the democratization of information, the power of collaboration and the personalization we hope to find in any school. Taking full advantage of Web 2.0 technology requires more than hardware and software, it requires adopting a Web 2.0 culture. In 1996, New Technology High School in Napa, California opened with a vision of reinventing high school for a new age. At the core of their approach was a culture, curriculum and technology foundation that empowered the student to take more control over their learning and the school. New Tech High is now a national model for school transformation with a network of over 40 21st Century schools based on those principals. Learn the specific strategies and technologies used by the New Technology Network to create a culture that is more student (user) centered in the classroom and encourage collaboration between students, teachers and schools. Having been asked to deliver truly cross-curricular ICT to support the Extra English lessons provided for a small group of students, I decioded to use a range of Web 2.0 tools to asist with this. Inspired by the work of Tom Barrett and We Tell Stories I decided to create an immersive experience that would help the students have a better understanding of the book. Amongst the tools I used for this were Stupeflix, Google Maps and Google Streetview. The students were able to produce work that was far more involved and detailed than that which they had produced before. As teachers we can be inspired by each other and this presentation is my tribute to this. This presentation will focus on an established successful 6th grade capstone project called The Biggest Dig. In the 5th year of this research project, myself and Jon Greenberg, the Humanities teacher, collaborated to modernize the project using web 2.0 technologies such as wikis and online note taking software. This video includes an overview of the project, review the tools used, how we decided to transition certain project components to web 2.0 tools, student feedback, and finally, a review of the final product and our assessments. The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate that teacher collaboration and sharing of ideas is a fundamental component to enhancing already established curriculum. The idea that you do not have to throw out everything you have done in the analog world to adapt to web 2.0 world is our central theme. After years of lobbying, my high school World Cultures course is now assigned to a computer lab each day during my school year. In this proto-one-to-one environment, I am attempting a largely paperless classroom. Using Moodle, Web 2.0 tools and a mix of liberal computer lab hours and checkout laptops, I have eliminated the paper shuffle from my World Cultures class. I am now three months into my project and ready to report the early results including its impact on my other courses. This workshop is part of the K12 Online Conference and is designed for the K-12 administrator looking to dip their toe into Web 2.0. What do you get when you cross Moodle with Google Apps with Drupal? Moogpal! This presentation provides a preview of the development work currently underway by New Tech Network of high schools to integrate these free and open source tools to personalize learning, improve communication, and spur collaboration. The video includes an overview of why we chose these tools, their unique characteristics, and shows early mock-ups of how we plan to use them across our nationwide network of 40 high schools. To begin, I want you to know I created a wiki that expands upon the notions I discuss in this presentation/video. If you find what I say worthy of further reflection, carry your learning beyond the boundaries of the .mov and visit tr.im/bridginggaps. If you wonder what a well-educated student will look like in our constantly shifting, interconnected, globalized society; if you want to know what teachers and administrators need to know about teaching and learning in the 21st Century; if you are ready to learn about newer, more effective ways of teaching that engage, challenge and inspire students; this is the session for you. In this video I will present a vision for teaching and learning in the 21st century that is evolving as I explore the intersection of pedagogy and the digital culture. There are twelve critical bridges that span competing conditions I have experienced that we must all acknowledge, experience and understand if we are to move toward the emerging new story of learning. This presentation is a joint venture between a classroom teacher, Jean Moore and instructional tech specialist, Robin Beaver. Jeans 7th grade students study Asia as part of their Social Studies/Literature curriculum. Over the past several years Jean has developed a number of projects involving technology to enrich these units of study. These activities have evolved over time in order to take advantage of the capabilities of new technologies. In this video we share ways in which Web 2.0 tools have helped to transform this unit and the impact this had on student collaboration and learning. Supporting materials include links to resources and activities used by Jean as well as tutorials for two of the tools mentioned. In this session I outline the movement towards multiple literacies and 21st century literacies.  Within this framework I present concrete strategies and methods for pursing the traditional notion of literacy  reading and writing fluency  in an online context.   In particular I hope to show how think alouds and other literacy modeling strategies can be enhanced by Web 2.0 technologies like Diigo for social bookmarking and Screentoaster for easy screen capture and content delivery. Part of this enhancement comes from the ability to customize instruction to individual student needs and interests.  This presentation is a relatively equal mix of teaching theory, literacy pedagogy, and technology integration. Learn how to empower students through the use of Google SketchUp. A somewhat provocative viewpoint of what constitutes an ePortfolio and a very brief cursory overview of the use of one ePortfolio tool that can be integrated within a VLE. The presentation will suggest that ePortfolios are ubiquitous, its just that they are not seen as such. How can non-traditional ePortfolio formats be formalised, accepted and given authority? In fact what IS an ePortfolio? 21st Century School Leaders are critical to the success of students and the advancement of technology integration in our schools. But would you know a 21st Century Leader if you saw one? My presentation describes how the standards for good leadership match up with the standards for being a 21st Century Leader. Much of digital citizenship education focuses on adults compiling information to share with students, this method provides a framework for students to conduct authentic research with global partners on the aspects of digital citizenship and creation of action projects at their schools. This presentations goal is to: 1) demonstrate the efficacy of a project based approach to digital citizenship education, 2) provide insight into teen-mentoring of younger students, 3) effective coaching practices for teachers and educators wishing to encourage a project based learning approach to digital citizenship, 4) an overview of the aspects of digital citizenship salient to teenagers around the world and what they think the message of educators should be to their students, and 5) a concrete experience allowing students who have thoroughly researched this topic to share their thoughts with a global audience and engage in global discussion on this. This is a compilation of student views, research, and beliefs as it relates to digital topics and how these should be taught in schools. New users of virtual worlds can find the interfaces and controls of 3D platforms difficult and confusing. Currently in Second life new users initially find their avatars in a space for orientation with other new users and possibly with helpers and guides to assist them. This video looks at different approaches to the design of these areas. Every educator needs to build and maintain his or her own teacher Website. Technology provides teachers with more effective ways to communicate with students, their families, and the community than ever before. This session will help you learn how to use technology to communicate with different audiences through your classroom website. There are endless benefits of a maintaining a classroom Website. A classroom website gives students Resources, Relevance, Connections, Access and Experience. This session will provide links and resources to simple tools that allow any teacher, regardless of technical know-how, to create a live Website for free. The best way is for schools to install and support a tool that allows teachers to create Websites easily, but since many schools are not at that point yet, teachers should given both the encouragement and the freedom to build their own sites. You can make use of some very good tools for building free, live classroom Websites. I may leave out your favorite, so please add yours to the list, or tell us know what tool your school is using and what you like and dislike about it! A chat with Jen Wagner about Online Projects. Ideas of how to start planning your own project. Several projects will be highlighted as examples and possibilities. Are you using your iPod Touch/iPhone to simply check your email or answer your phone? Did you know that there many other uses of the iPod Touch that can help with some of your professional responsibilities? This presentation will show you apps and success stories from administrators in the field that are using the iPod Touch/iPhone for data collection, organization, creating a mobile office, and personal professional development. Bored by status quo professional development and stale in service workshops? Why not throw a party! LAN: Learning Is Social is the story of how North Vancouver School District used the presentations of the K12 Online Conference to breathe new life into professional development. \\r\\nLAN parties can be a powerful vehicle for professional development and change. This presentation defines the concept and shares our experience with the hope that others will be inspired to find creative ways to share the message of the K-12 Online Conference. Current accepted forms of professional development provide opportunities for small bites and quick-fix solutions but do not encourage immersion, ongoing conversations and collaborative sharing of experiences. Adoption of a learning confluence amongst educators can and will make a difference within a school and extend the learning beyond the immediate environment. Based on recent practice at an international school, a model of teacher engagement and improved pedagogical approach has been developed that leads the way into transformed learning in the classroom. Using a face-to-face meeting format, including expert advisers and a virtual component, educators extended their learning boundaries and embraced constructivism with the purpose of challenging themselves to lean into the sharp edges of 21st century education. Videoconferencing can bring the world to your classroom. It allows educators to bridge the divide by bringing experiences to rural students; by engaging conversations and interactions between urban and rural students and by connecting students globally. Whether using desktop videoconferencing or room based videoconferencing, educators can bridge the divide between dabbling in videoconferencing to fully integrating with solid classroom instructional strategies. Rather than sending all pupils work home at the end of the school year, E-books allow teachers to compile collections of work to be displayed on the WWW quite soon after it is completed. Colin Hill presents how he creates E-books, proving to eb a motivation for writing, as learners know that their work is going to be on display The iPod Touch can function as an important educational tool inside and outside the classroom. With the increased purchases of netbooks this last year, there seems to be a push for schools to put more machines into students hands. At a price point even lower than current netbooks the iPod Touch is a great compliment to any classroom. While many schools still do not allow cell phones, an iPod Touch bridges that gap. Wifi access provides a tremendous opportunity for students and teachers to browse the web, type a response, record audio or calculate a problem. The form factor makes many classroom tasks manageable while the design of the device requires far less technical support than most laptops. The main focus of this presentation is how teachers can accomplish common tasks in the classroom, but also includes how students can use the tool for their own studies. Most of the applications discussed are free or a few dollars. Viewers will learn concrete ways they can use their iPod Touch in the classroom the following day. Using Chris Argyriss theories of learning, this presentation describes how we can better understand the way we make decisions when planning student learning experiences and considering the use of technology. Using Argyriss Theories of Action show us how we can evaluate our instructional decisions, and exploring Argyriss theory of single and double loop learning establishes a strong framework that can guide our decisions of when and how to utilize technology in learning. Based on Guy Claxtons statement that schools should become communities of practice where  the elders of the community are themselves exemplary learners (Claxton, 2002), this presentation explores the importance of Classroom-Based Teacher Development and Reflective Practice as essential professional development practices for the 21st century. It suggests that if students today are to benefit from schools where they can acquire the learning dispositions that will allow them to build and transform future societies and address global challenges, teacher professional development must be reconfigured to allow teachers to focus on examining and learning from their own professional contexts. The 21st century demands that teachers investigate their practices on a regular basis, learn to design new approaches, and quickly and effectively respond to the demands of the ever-changing knowledge society. Classrooms must therefore become sites of inquiry where teachers engage in practice that is perpetually experimental. Learn about the whats, hows and whys of using web 2.0 tools and social networking with elementary age students to enhance learning and student engagement. In this student-produced keynote, Joyce and the students of Springfield Township High Schools Theatre II class consider which apps are the most critical as they walk the road together. Looking at daily life in foreign lands reveals a colorful spectrum of inspiring metaphors for the shifts we need to make in education. Often what we may find initially chaotic, disorienting and strange in other countries can actually spark new ways of thinking about teaching and learning. Through the voices of teachers and students from around the world, well examine the unique aptitudes which allow successful expats to thrive in any environment. These are exactly the skills that future students and teachers will need to confidently enter the digital, global, converging, collaborative world of tomorrow  wherever they might be physically located.']\n",

In Episode 27 we come to you \"Live\" from the haunted Lizzie Borden house in Fall River, Massachusetts. Okay, not totally \"live\" because we filmed the episode about a week before it aired. Nobody does a documentary like the 30 Odd Minutes crew! And Lizzie Borden is no different. Just like our studio show we do the whole thing live, straight-through, in one take.

Basically the guy went to MIT, he\\'s really smart, and when he noticed his workshop space seemed to be haunted, he applied what he knows to try and figure it all out. Don\\'t miss some incredible video footage captured on Coppock\\'s security camera and full spectrum camera. Plus, in this episode we debut the newest members of the Oddball crew. But is he human?

In Episode Eighteen we talk astral projection and out of body experiences (OBEs) with acclaimed author and mystic Robert Bruce. Based in Western Australia, Bruce had his first out of body experience at age four and has since spent his life actively exploring metaphysical, paranormal, and spiritual phenomena.

      "[ 'A Very Nuclear Winter, with the Select Button Dot Net Panel of Judges. The Select Button Panel of Judges talks ALL Nintendo 64, almost ALL of the time. We discuss games that have theme park styles designs -- whether done overtly (Super Mario Sunshine) or through a lack of cohesion in setting (many 16-bit era platformers).  Cool Spot 4 lyfe/Avoid the Noid! This episode we talk about games that are either set primarily in rural locations or employ rural locations in their narratives.  Also shrug goes \"hog wild\".  NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU FOR THE 2016 BUTTON PUSHERS GAME AWARDS. There was a podcast here. Strange, now there\\'s just a note that says \"tell my family and friends that I loved them\"? With the podcast back in full effect, we talk about the perception of licensed games and how that perception has changed over time.   This episode we delve into all manners of input devices, talking about ways they have (and haven\\'t) changed over the decades. The Mass Effect Podcast.  We take a look back at BioWare\\'s space-opera superman date sim killstravaganza for some memories, some laughs, and a very timely review of Bethesda\\'s Daggerfall. Get on your space boxer-briefs and get listenin\\'. This episode: a selectbutton.net retrospective.  We reflect on the inception of our own website, do a bit of introspection on where we were as a community circa December 6, 2006, and where we\\'ve come since then. A bit different from our last mech-related podcast, here.  This episode we talk about games that nail the feeling of being at the controls of a giant, massive, hulking machine, and there\\'s also a long tangent about the downhill slide avalanche that is the Xeno series.  Don\\'t miss it!   Actual flying in space is pretty flippin\\' complicated, it turns out, so in our space sim episode we talk about which games draw the line between fun and outright simulation.  We also talk about people who have a dangerous interest in EVE Online, the influence of Star Wars in pretty much every space dogfighting game, Wing Commander, and why no game has really given you the feeling of commanding on the bridge in Star Trek.   Slightly overdue selectbutton.net podcast returns in a hilarious special episode where Sonic has a misunderstanding at the office, Ryo gets in trouble with the principle, and Uncle Sega bets it ALL ON BLUE.  Tune in for nearly three hours of tears on the 13 birthday of the Dreamcast!

THE RUDEST MUSIC.  THE SICKEST TIPS.  SELECTBUTTON.COM. This episode is all about Japanese video game developer Treasure.  We are prepared to live in the plain and die in the plain. Well it looks like you\\'ve been pretty good this year so we\\'re resurrecting a holiday tradition (please forget that we did not resurrect this last year).\\r\\n\\r\\nJoin us as we fly blind in cold weather: heady topics abound as we talk about the guy that looks like Justin Bieber in the UMVC SoCal Regionals Finals, the strangeness of Square\\'s output during the PSX era, people who think James in Silent Hill 2 is a swell guy, the underwhelming amount of mystery in gaming, the overwhelming terribleness of Hard Corps: Uprising, the PSP Vita, the copy of NCIS: The Game: Based on the Hit TV Series that\\'s still sitting on my desk, and much much much much much much more. S**t! If you\\'ve payed even a scant amount of attention around here you\\'ve probably picked up on the general enthusiasm and fervor some of us have for From Software\\'s \"Soul\" series: Demon\\'s Souls and Dark Souls. We once did an experimental episode of the podcast which featured some footage of co-op in Demon\\'s Souls, way back in episode 22.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course Dark Souls has been released since we did that, so in this episode we broaden the topic to include that game as well as its predecessor series: King\\'s Field. This episode is about the appeal of these games, and what makes their experiences meaningful. We talk about the effectiveness of their atmosphere, the density of their combat, and the exhilarating ridiculousness of their PvP. Furthermore, someone will die at the end of this episode!  The SBDNPC peers over the edge and takes a long and ponderous look at the Metroid series. After a decade of making games, Cavia has ceased to exist, and are now virtually seconds away from being forgotten forever by everyone. That sure didn\\'t stop us from dedicating an episode to them, though. For as long as vidcons have existed there\\'s been a driving need to adapt their narratives into other types of media - books, television, movies, comic books, cereal - this episode we take a look at that creative process. This epsiode, ROM hacking.  From silly sprite edits to translations to total conversions, we talk about our favorites from over the years.  Panel also discusses hacks they\\'ve either contributed to or created over the years.  The Game Boy was a damn good platform, in the end.  Built for battery life and technically inferior to the competition, but time after time developers (well, first party mostly) embraced the limitations of the system to bring us some of the best entries in many long running series... and yeah there were plenty of developers who missed the point to hilarious effect too, in attempting to shrink 8-bit and 16-bit console experiences down with no no forethought. Goddamn it why did I forget to mention Revenge of the \\'Gator.  STG\\'s, Shooting Games, SHUMPS, Cute\\'Em ups, Virtual Loli Witch Simulators: whatever you choose to call them, some of us really really love playing them, and I\\'m proud to present to you one of the most dense and informative podcasts about a genre in the show\\'s history.

The gang gets together to talk about how they like makin\\' games, and thinkin\\' \\'bout the game design process.  Apol joins a little late and talks about ZZT, MegaZeux, and working on his game. Diplo joins even later and talks about art cookies and friendly spikes. Don\\'t miss it! This episode we talk about the evolution of level design in the first person shooter genre - from Wolfenstein 3D and Rainbow Six to Deus Ex and Halo. Well over a year later, we open the gates on another podcast about fightman genre of games. This time we talk about the release of MVC 3, the evolution of arcade culture, and some fighting games that are on the horizon... and some that are not! In this episode we talk about platformers.  Our favorite games, the strange stuff, and things best left forgotten.  The odds, ends and the thousands of bottomless chasms inbetween them.

      "10 [u'A Cape Cod Notebook from WCAI' 'Local']\n",
      "[ 'At a recent dinner with old friends, someone brought up the topic of the Target Ship. For over a half a century, the target ship was a familiar and legendary sight in Cape Cod Bay for those of us who lived near the elbow of the Cape. The coast assumes a different character in winter. In A Cape Cod Notebook, Robert Finch sets out on a solitary walk in the Provincelands, visiting the dune shacks that stand against the wind in a desolate landscape. Sometimes wandering into a coffee shop can enter you into a whole new world. On Nauset Beach, Robert Finch contemplates the presence of eiders, and their embodiment of a natural community. This week on A Cape Cod Notebook, Robert Finch strolls the beach in winter. If theres anything than interests me more than local history, it\\'s unrecorded local history  that is, events, stories, characters and places that live only in the memories of long-time residents  and sometimes not even there, sometimes only in the shapes of certain landscapes, or in the presence of mute but evocative objects that require the beholder to shape and piece together a tentative narrative about their history. One of the most intriguing examples for this sort of unrecorded history Early last month, on my way home from a dentist appointment, I stopped at Coast Guard Beach in Eastham at the end of the day. I have a long history with this barrier beach, going back to the 1960s, when there were still a dozen or so beach shacks strung along its length. In today\\'s Cape Cod Notebook, Robert Finch takes us along on a walk through Wellfleet, from Duck Creek Harbor to Cannon Hill. Last winter, two friends from Oregon visited us for a weekend. On Sunday I took them out to the dunes of the Provincelands, following a series of familiar sand-marks that I have traced across this ever-changing and forever-unchanging landscape for more than half a century. The North Truro Air Force Base was located at the very eastern edge of the Highland Plains, and thus afforded a spectacular ocean view to the military personnel and their families that lived there. A double cyclone fence topped with barbed wire surrounded the base: an outer one around its perimeter, including the cliff edge, and an inner one protecting the military compound, the command center, and the radar domes. This concludes a two-part essay on the old North Truro Air Force Base and its In my adolescence I was an avid science fiction reader, and one of my favorite books was Ray Bradburys iconic collection of stories, The Martian Chronicles . It was published in 1950 at the beginning of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race . One of the most poignant and quietly chilling of Bradburys tales is called And There Will Come Soft Rains. The other day I was walking one of those old, overgrown, and nearly invisible dirt roads on Bound Brook Island  the site of Wellfleets first settlement in the late 17 th century, and now largely abandoned. I love wandering in such places of unrecorded and unidentified history, history that resides purely in things and not ideas, not even my own. I drove down to Paine\\'s Creek at dusk with coffee and a Danish from the nearby Dunkin Donuts. The beach was white and clean in the dying light. The marsh grass was all tawny, heavy and thick in the fullness of its growth. It toppled over itself in windrows with its own accumulated mass, weighted like the heavy boughs of the apple tree behind my garden. It was this month, thirty years ago, that Hollywood came to the Outer Cape. The occasion was the filming of Norman Mailers crime novel, Tough Guys Dont Dance , which was set in Provincetown. It wasnt a very good novel, and the film wasnt much better, but it starred Ryan ONeil and Isabella Rossellini, and for a week or two some people were excited about the possibility of sighting a movie star or two in our small villages in the off-season. I am sitting on the beach at Long Point, my legs stretched out towards the town that rests in unmistakable outline across the Harbor. I have, as it were, Provincetown at my feet. This is surely the best vantage point from which to view it, nestled, in Joseph Berger\\'s sly image, \"like a piece of silver that has just crossed the palm of Cape Cod.\" On the previous broadcast I described some of the major damage that this four-day northeast gale  known as the Perfect Storm - did to the Capes beaches and shoreline structures over the Halloween weekend in 1991. But what remains most vivid in my memory is the effect the storm had on the Capes bird life, in particular, gannets. This coming weekend marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of an extraordinary meteorological event that was known variously as The Halloween Gale or The No-Name Storm of 1991. But perhaps its best remembered as The Perfect Storm the term used by meteorologists to describe an unusual alignment of three major weather systems along the northeast coast  a perfect alignment, if you will, that produced a northeast storm of almost unprecedented length and intensity. The other day I drove down to the Nauset Light Beach parking lot in North Eastham for the first time since Labor Day. Somehow, in its off-season emptiness, I was struck even more than usual at how extensive and labyrinthine a maze the entrance to this beach has become over time. When we think of town conservation areas, we usually think of large tracts of protected land, places like the 1200-acre West Barnstable Conservation Area, or perhaps somewhat smaller tracts like the 44-acre Wiley Park in Eastham. But over the past couple of decades there have been dozens of other, smaller conservation areas created on the Cape and Islands, all of them less than twenty acres in extent, and most under ten. We are about to enter northeaster season, that time of year when ocean storms strafe our exposed peninsula, often rearranging its topography. They also tend to rearrange our image of ourselves, from that of beleaguered residents enduring the onslaught of summer tourists to that of rugged New Englanders, enduring our character-building climate of winter gales and occasional blizzards.']\n",
